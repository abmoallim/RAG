The goal of retrieval-based models is to search a large knowledge base—this could be a database of articles, reports, or any relevant documents—and find the most suitable content in response to a query. The mechanism here is fairly straightforward: When the system receives a query (e.g., \"How can we improve water distribution systems in Somalia?\"), it uses algorithms like BM25 or even dense retrieval techniques such as those powered by BERT to comb through the database and return relevant documents."
