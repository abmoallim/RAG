## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for Rebuilding Somalia Hackathon

### Project Summary
This project demonstrates the implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), a hybrid model that combines retrieval-based and generative AI techniques to produce more accurate, data-driven responses. The example showcased in this repository focuses on solving real-world challenges in Somalia, specifically using RAG to assist with hackathon projects. The goal is to use RAG to retrieve relevant, up-to-date information and generate factually grounded solutions, especially in domains like healthcare, infrastructure, and education.

### Features
- Hybrid retrieval-generation model for generating factually accurate responses.
- Uses Hugging Faceâ€™s `transformers` and `faiss` libraries.
- Practical use cases for generating solutions to post-conflict challenges in Somalia.
